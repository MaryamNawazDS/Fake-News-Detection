# Fake-News-Detection

The objective of this project is to identify fake news from real news articles. We'll analyze the sentiment of various sources like tweets, speeches, reviews, and blogs, and classify news stories as either genuine or fake. To achieve this, we've utilized two methods: Boolean Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes. We trained a classifier using a provided dataset, and we've also preprocessed the data to handle negations. Additionally, we experimented with including and excluding stop words. In testing, we evaluated the classifiers' performance using measures such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score.
